  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>I have extensive experience in software testing, customer service, and sales operations.
  As a User Acceptance Tester at FixMyCar.com (2023-present) and The Open University (2020-2023),
  I executed test plans, scripts, and procedures for various projects, features and software.
  I conducted regression testing and implemented test plans. Prior to my career switch to being a UAT,
  I supported the Student Recruitment Team (2016-2020), providing guidance, enrolment assistance,
  and improving processes. At Symantec (2012-2015), I analysed sales data, tracked performance,
  and helped inform strategic decisions. Earlier, as a Customer Services Team Leader at Virgin Media (2005-2007),
  I led a team of 30 agents, managed escalations, and trained new advisors to maintain high service levels.
